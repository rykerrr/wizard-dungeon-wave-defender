Repo for first project being done via TDD, and focus on writing actually readable code and much better tests
- Assemblies
- Proper usage of the new Input system
- Unit tests improvement based mostly on the second edition of The Art Of Unit Testing by Michael Feathers and Robert C. Martin.
- Usage of certain useful free assets for code that i find myself re-writing constantly from time to time (State machines) or that are just very nice (Custom event system via scriptable events)
- Extensive usage of scriptable objects
- Usage of multiple OOP patterns
- Focusing on modularity and reusability on certain common systems such as Attribute/Stat systems, Movement systems, Inventories
