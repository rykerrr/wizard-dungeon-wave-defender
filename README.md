Repo for first project being done via TDD, and focus on writing actually readable code and much better tests
- Assemblies
- Actual decent usage of the new Input system
- Better naming convention for unit tests, nested classes for methods being tested + (somewhat) proper usage of test cases for
- Usage of certain useful free assets for code that i find myself re-writing constantly from time to time (State machines) or that are just very nice (Custom event system via scriptable events)
- Following SOLID with a high focus on interface segregation
- Usage of Scriptable Objects for more than just being a very low level data container
